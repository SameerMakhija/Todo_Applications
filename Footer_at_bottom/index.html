            <p>In this demo the footer is pushed to the bottom of the screen 
                in all standards compliant web browsers even when there is only 
                a small amount of content on the page. This with work with IE 6 
                and IE 5.5 too. Non-standards compliant browsers degrade gracefully 
                by positioning the footer under the content as per normal. Read the 
                full article for all the details.
